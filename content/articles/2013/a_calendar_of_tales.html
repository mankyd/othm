    I love <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman's</a> work. So when
    I disovered a new collection of his short stories online, I became ecstatic.
    <a href="http://keepmoving.blackberry.com/desktop/en/us/ambassador/neil-gaiman.html">
      A Calendar of Tales</a> is a collection of twelver short stories that he
    has written based on twitter responses to a series of questions that he
    posted online. I only wish that I had discovered it sooner.

    What particularly draws me to his style of writing is that he exemplifies
    the practice of "show, don't tell" when he writes. He throws you into the 
    first story just as quickly as the character he is introducing has been
    thrown in, ("disoriented", "unfocused"). Yet by the end of the tale,  you
    understand what's happening and what's unfolding without ever being told.
    It's absolutely brilliant storytelling.
