    In my article the other day about the
    <a href="|filename|article/2013/canned_tomatoes.html">states of matter of
      canned tomatoes</a>, I forgot to mention one disgustingly horrible form
    of canned tomatoes that one used to be able to find:
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tomato+aspic&tbm=isch">Tomato
      Aspic</a>. Thankfully, in canned form, tomato aspic is largely
    unavailable these days I hope that it remains that way. (Full disclosure:
    my great grandmother forced me to eat tomato aspic with just about every
    meal when I visited her. I had never though jello could make me gag so
    quickly.)

    For those not in the know,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspic">aspic</a> is a form of savory 
    gelatin. Think of it as salty jello with a hint of sour. It is vile stuff.
    The Wikipedia page on aspic prominently features a gelatin with both chicken
    and hardboiled eggs suspended within it. It was commonly used as a method to
    preserve food.

    Tomato aspic takes the worst part of savory jello and combines it with raw 
    tomato pur√©e. It was a bad idea when someone thought it up and it remains
    a bad idea to this day. Just take a look at this loaf of congeled tomato
    sauce:

    Thankfully, the days of ambiguous matter-state tomato were largely left
    behind at the end of the 1950's. For those looking for some vintage tomato
    recipes, however, here's a delightful layered tomato aspic conconction
    courtesy of Wrigley's Spearmint Chewing Gum. Ingredients include onion,
    celery, cucumber, cottage cheese, green pepper, and of course, tomato sauce
    and gelatin. I am not sure why a chewing gum company used this as an 
    advertisement but perhaps it was because of the <i>awful</i> breath that 
    you'd be left with after biting into this abomination:
