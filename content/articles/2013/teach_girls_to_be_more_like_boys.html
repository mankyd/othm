    An 
    <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/30/opinion/simmons-girls-leadership/index.html" title="Teach Girls To Be More Like Boys">
      article on CNN</a> today gets gender bias issues rather ironically wrong.
    My wife and I were talking about this topic the other day. She would take
    issue with the title of this editorial, I believe. Not because the goal is
    wrong, but rather because the framing presented at the very outset is
    inherently gender biased. I would tend to agree with her.

  <p>
    My own suggestion, in our earlier conversation, was that, rather than 
    teaching "girls to be more like boys" our efforts might be better focused
    on making masculine traits less male. That is to say, as long as we
    characterize positive external traits (confidence, assertiveness, etc) as
    being masculine traits, they will continue to be dominated by males.
  <p>
    If we're going to encourage young women to take on these traits, we need to
    make them gender-neutral, universally <i>acceptable</i> traits. I am not
    suggesting that we rename them or some other superficial, token gesture. I
    am simply pointing out that, when we want a woman to succeed, we can't 
    simply say to her "be more like a man". We need to say "be strong; be 
    confident", without the pretenses of taking on masculine qualities.

    In the interest of full disclosure, I should add that I am a graduate of
    the high school mentioned in the article.
