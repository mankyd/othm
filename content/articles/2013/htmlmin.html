    I've written an
    <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/htmlmin" title="htmlmin">HTML
      minification library</a> that's ready for release. <code>pip 
      install htmlmin</code> should get you going.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is statically generated via <a href="http://getpelican.com">
      pelican</a> and I noticed that the content generated by it was not as 
    compact as it could be. I started looking into existing HTML minification
    solutions and was left disappointed. I found one,
    <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-htmlmin">django-htmlmin</a>
    that left me disappointed - it relies on 
    <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>,
    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, and other libraries,
    which in turn have lots of other, non-HTML dependencies such as MySQL.
    Furthermore, it isn't really that featureful or well designed, as I looked
    through the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    htmlmin has no dependencies other than Python's builtin HTMLParser. It has
    features that allow you to fine tune how the HTML gets minified and allows 
    you to easily mark up your HTML inline to demarcate non-minifieable areas.
    It follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/">HTML 5</a> 
    specification closely to account for non-closed tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's still a few more features that I want to add. Specifically, I want
    to add a feature that allows removal of opening and closing tags where
    allowed by the HTML5 specification. I also want it to recognize 
    <code>whitespace: pre</code> inside of inline style tags. Those will come in
    the next version of the software as I design tests for them.
