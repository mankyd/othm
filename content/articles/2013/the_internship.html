    I just returned from a company outing to see "The Internship". I had set my
    expectations kind of low, but was pleasantly surprised. It's not 
    <i>great</i> per se but is cute. Working for the company portrayed in the 
    movie, they give a pretty good recreation of the campus and the company 
    backdrop. But I take issue with the one thing that they get very, 
    <i>very</i> wrong about Google: the people.

    In the movie, work hours are long, the people are straight-up mean, and the
    corporate culture is cut throat. The interns are told that their Summer 
    program is a little more than a competition, a "mental Hunger Games" as 
    they call it. 95% of them will not be given jobs. Unfortunately, (in the
    movie) this turns out to exactly be the case - the protagonists and their
    team end up employed but at the expense of the hundred or so other bright
    and capable interns.

    The full-time employees are don't fair much better in the script writer's
    hands. The two shown most frequently are rude, over-worked, and generally
    mean-spirited people. The term "googley" is bandied about, but those that 
    use it are laughed and derided.

    This runs exactly contrary to everything that I've experienced in my time
    at Google. Google is full of incredible people, kind people, and thoughtful
    people. I had never worked at a place before this where each person that I
    meet is universally generous and outgoing. While there are some jokes about
    the word "googley", no one would deny that it is a positive attribute and
    something that they would like ascribed to themselves.

    Are my coworkers at Google smart? Yes, but they aren't braggarts. Do they
    work hard? Yes, but not a the expense of their own well being. Are
    expectations here high? Yes, but they're not unreasonable. Google
    accomplishes great things not by virtue of fostering a hostile environment.
    Google accomplishes great things by employing great people and encouraging
    them to succeed.
