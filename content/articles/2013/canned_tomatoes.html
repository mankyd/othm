    There are a lot of canned tomato products. I mean, seriously, it's a little
    silly. Last night, while grocery shopping with my wife, I was asked to
    retrieve a cans of diced tomatoes, tomato purée, and tomato sauce. While 
    searching through the mulitudes of sizes and flavors, I absent mindedly
    swapped purée for paste and grabbed the wrong can.
  </p>
  <p>
    What took me back as I was searching was just how little I understood about
    canned tomato products and why they exist in such variety. So I decided to
    do some investigation: what types of canned tomatoes can one find in a 
    typical American grocery store and what are they used for.
  </p>
  <h3>Whole Tomatoes</h3>
  <p>
    Starting from the largest and working our way down, we have whole tomatoes, 
    both peeled and unpeeled. Peeled tomatoes are the most common variant and
    are made by first
    <a href="http://www.foodinjars.com/2009/09/canning-whole-peeled-tomatoes/">
      briefl boiling them</a> to make the skin looser, removing the skin, and 
    then placing them into a jar or can. While not particularly appetizing by 
    themselves, they're easily turned into other "states" of tomato. Some 
    sources that I have found suggest that canned, whole tomatoes are of a 
    higher quality than other, more processed varieties, with the manufacturers
    sending dud tomatoes off to be chopped up.
  </p>
  <h3>Stewed Tomatoes</h3>
  <p>
    A varient of whole tomatoes, stewed tomatoes have been cooked &mdash; boiled
    longer than a typical whole tomato. This releases the flavor and makes them
    more suitable for adding to many recipes. Of course, it's easy enough to 
    cook whole tomatoes, especially if the dish you'll be adding them to will
    be cooking further anyways. It is common to find stewed tomatoes with added
    ingredients and seasoning.
  </p>
  <h3>Diced Tomatoes</h3>
  <p>
    Diced (or chopped) tomatoes save some of the labor involved with working
    with whole tomatoes. Fairly self explanatory, they work well in salsas and
    sauces where you want full pieces of tomato. On the grocery store shelf, I
    found plain old diced and petite diced, as well as a myriad of flavor
    additives such as garlic, pepper, and oregano. 
    <a href="http://www.hunts.com/products/tomatoes/diced-tomatoes">Hunt's 
      website</a> lists no less than <em>14</em> different varieties. Yes, you
    read than correctly, one-four - fourteen.
  <h3>Crushed Tomatoes</h3>
  <p>
    Take your canned tomatoes and mash them up. Boom, crushed tomatoes!
    Typically, crushed tomatoes will be run through a strainer to remove seeds
    and other large chunks. They're great for sauces and chilis where you're
    looking and some of the texture of tomatoes without the chunks.
  </p>
  <h3>Tomato Purée</h3>
  <p>
    Crushed tomatoes still too chunky for you? Try purée. Take the same, whole
    tomatoes but blend them instead of just crushing them. You'll still need to
    strain them to get the seeds and other large chunks out. This is what foods
    like pizza sauce and ketchup start as.
  </p>
  <h3>Tomato Sauce</h3>
  <p>
    So far as I can tell, tomato sauce is to tomato purée as stewed tomatoes are
    to whole tomatoes. It's been both liquified and then cooked. It will often
    have seasonings added to it as well. This is different than your typical
    "pasta" sauces, mind you, which almost certainly have added seasonings and
    non-tomato ingredients and may include chunks of tomatoes.
  </p>
  <h3>Tomato Paste</h3>
  <p>
    Tomato paste is the last major variation that canned tomatoes come in (to my
    knowledge). You take the tomato purée or sauce from the prior categories and
    then you cook it more. And then you cook it more. And then some more.
    Tomato paste is effectively highly reduced tomato sauce that has had most of
    its liquid cooked off. This is used when you want to add tomato flavor to a
    dish without adding extra liquid to a dish. It can actually help to thicken
    a dish to a modest degree.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've made it this far, you should be pretty amazed at the various
    phases of matter that tomatoes can exist in. I mean, holy crap, that's a lot
    of tomato. I don't even like tomato all that much and I am impressed. If you
    start throwing in all the flavors, extra ingredients, and low-sodium 
    varieties, the multitude of options is staggering.
