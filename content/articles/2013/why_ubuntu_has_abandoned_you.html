    Ever since <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> released 
    <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">Unity</a> in 2011 as the default desktop
    environment for their operating system
    <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> , there have been angry rumblings
    from the Linux community over the degradation of desktop experience. Then, in
    what many took as further provocation, Canonical introduced 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#12.10_Amazon_controversy">
      Amazon.com "Lens" integration</a>, allowing users of Unity to search Amazon
    directly from their desktop environment by default. This has been widely 
    reviled by the community that once exalted Ubuntu as a shining example of 
    Linux's growing maturity and adoption. Why has Canonical chosen a product path
    that seems to be progressively upsetting more and more of their core user base?
    A newly released video from yesterday should being to make this abundantly
    clear:

  <!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
  <h3>What Ubuntu Was</h3>
  <p>
    I am going to go ahead and say that 2008 was 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Linux#Year_of_Desktop_Linux">
      "The Year of the Linux Desktop"</a>. Compiz was beginning to make Gnome
    beautiful. Dell was shipping desktop computers with Ubuntu preinstalled. Flash
    and Skype, popular applications in the desktop world, both had native Linux
    support that worked modestly well. A quick look at
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ubuntu">Google Trends</a>
    shows Ubuntu, as a search term, peaking in late 2007 and riding high through
    next few years. Without going into further detail, it's safe to say that, in
    2008, you could pick up the phone, order a Linux based desktop computer from
    major manufacturer that included full warranty and customer support, plug it
    in yourself in your own home, and expect it to work well.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was driven, by and large, by quality work that Canonical put in to
    develop a well rounded, fundamentally solid desktop experience. This is not to
    discredit the thousands of non-Canonical individuals and groups who
    contributed the open source pieces that made up the operating system, but
    rather I am highlighting the fact that Canonical took a bunch of reasonably
    functional pieces of software and started <em>polishing</em> them, tailoring
    them towards an experience that your average desktop user wanted. They made
    sure that hardware drivers installed themselves and that popular software was
    kept featureful and up to date. The baked in pretty pictures and colors into
    the desktop themes that had theretofore required a lot of fiddling and
    customization on behalf of the user. They made Linux approachable.
  </p>
  <h3>And Then Mobile Happened</h3>
  <p>
    For this effort, Canonical deserves accolades. They made desktop Linux work.
    Yet making a free, easy to use desktop environment is hardly a strong business
    model. And while Canonical was working hard to make a working desktop
    environment, along came the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">iPhone</a>, and the computing
    landscape fundamentally changed.
  </p>
  <p> This took time of course. While the iPhone made a big splash in the market,
    it took at least a little while for the full impact of their product to be
    felt. It wasn't until a year after its initial debut that Apple released their
    app store. Meanwhile, in 2005, Google had purchased
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>,
    but it didn't release their first phone until 2008, a few months after Apple
    opened their app store.
  </p>
  <p>
    And even now in 2013, five years after our "Year of the Linux Desktop", the
    full force of the smartphone takeover is only just beginning to be fully
    appreciated. Traditional mobile companies like Nokia and Blackberry now
    appear to be in their death throes. Google only released their popular
    Chrome browser for their phone in 2012. Tablets like the iPad and Nexus
    lines have only just started to reach wider adoption by the population in
    the past year or two. Companies like Mozilla and Opera
    are <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2013/02/13/">shifting
    strategies</a> to help them
    find <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/">a place in the
    market</a>. The fallout from the mobile revolution is just hitting the
    ground, and Canonical can't become a victim.
  </p>
  <h3>You Are Not Their Target Audience</h3>
  <p>
     And so Canonical is adapting their strategy. Or perhaps it is more accurate
     to say, Canonical has always planned to monetize consumer Ubuntu
     &mdash; mobile is simply giving them the method. If you watch the video
     above closely, every feature that the Linux community has been criticizing
     them for looks like it belongs; the features look <em>good</em> on a mobile
     platform. If anything, Canonical should be praised for integrating with
     third-party providers like Amazon before pushing their own soft-stores,
     like iTunes and Play. Yes, Ubuntu comes with the Canonical supported
     app-store, but that's more out of necessity then anything. On an
     Ubuntu operating system, it is trivial to install software from other
     sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ubuntu users who complain loudest about the direction that the operating
    system is headed have never been the users Canonical intended on
    targeting. Prior to Ubuntu's success, desktop Linux had a niche
    following. When Ubuntu improved upon the desktop experience, many of those
    people made the switch and convinced their technologically capable friends
    to do the same. And as Ubuntu continues to evolve <i>past</i> the desktop
    and on to mobile, those desktop enthusiasts are now feeling left
    behind. That's because <em>they are</em> being left behind. Canonical has
    bigger plans for Ubuntu.
  </p>
  <h3>And That's Ok</h3>
  <p>
    Ubuntu had a really good thing going on in the late 2000's. Ubuntu wasn't
    perfect, but it was building an excellent foundation for an amazing desktop
    experience. Recently, many point out, their desktop experience feels
    degraded. However, I am arguing, they still are making a great desktop
    experience &mdash; just for a different consumer.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are crafting the a <em>unified consumption device</em>; the computing
    experience that your parents, or your siblings, or your buddy wants. That
    statement probably doesn't sit well with every reader of this article, but
    it doesn't change the truth of the matter. When your average computer walks
    into an Apple store, they are not looking to purchase a highly customizable,
    minimilistic desktop environment with no bells and whistles. They want an
    entertainment device, (that they might also be able to do some work on
    &mdash; maybe). I actually found the above video when a graphic designer who
    I am friends with posted: "Sick UI! Watch all the way to the end." They're
    not building a system for traditional Linux users; they're building the
    exact opposite &mdash; a system that non-traditional Linux users want to
    use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet building such a system in the open source world is <i>awesome</i> for
    "traditional" users, even non-Ubuntu users. The stability and software
    improvements that get introduced into the Linux ecosystem due to this are
    practically invaluable. Graphic card companies, like AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel
    are drastically improving the quality of their drivers, pushed by companies
    like
    <a href="http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/Releases/NVIDIA-Delivers-Massive-Performance-Boost-to-Linux-Gaming-8ac.aspx">
    Valve</a>. Stability in desktop systems has improved by leaps and bounds as
    have support avenues on the web. All the changes that Ubuntu is driving in
    their mobile efforts are trickling into projects
    like <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, projects that don't
    have the business motives of Canonical, but do reap its benefits. Whether
    you use Ubuntu or not, there should be no doubt in your mind that desktop
    Linux stands to benefit from having a major player in market working to
    increase adoption.
