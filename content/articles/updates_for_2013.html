    It has occured to me that part of the reason that I started this site was
    because I wanted to practice my writing. That doesn't work if I don't
    write!

    A lot has happened in the past couple of years. I helped boostrap a 
    <a href="http://openmile.com/">trucking logistics company</a> in early 
    2010. Over the summer, I left that company [on good terms] and have 
    joined another, more <a href="https://www.google.com/">well known 
    company</a>.

    My role now involves working to help make the internet faster. I joined the
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights">PageSpeed
    Insights</a> team. It's been a great team to work with and I can already
    see some of my changes and researching making an impact on the development.
    If you have ideas for the team, feel free to send them my way or, better
    yet, hit the team up on 
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/page-speed-discuss">our mailing
    list</a>.

    I spent most of the weekend hacking on this site, getting my contributions
    to <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> squared away, and making a
    few new features as well. I threw the raw content of this site up on
    <a href="https://github.com/mankyd/othm">GitHub</a> and setup a webhook
    that publishes updates to the site as soon as I check them in. I'll have
    more details on how I did that in a future post. More importantly, I 
    really have no excuse for not updating the site anymore. It's as simply
    as a call to `git push`.

    Stay tuned for more!
