  <p>
    I don't add content to this site very often. I should. Part of
    the reason for that is I don't actually rememember <i>how</i>
    to get content to appear here.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I first setup this system up, I had it so that any content
    I checked into <a href="https://github.com/mankyd/othm/">github</a>
    would automatically regenerate the site and upload here. At some
    point that system stopped working, and my knowledge of how it
    was all setup atrophied.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am going to attempt to document my progress of getting it
    working again here. I'll hopefully be able to use this docunent
    as a reference in the future.

    First to specify what I know:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The content is hosted in github at 
        <a href="https://github.com/mankyd/othm/">https://github.com/mankyd/othm/</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        This site, I believe, is hosted on Google Cloud. I can access this by
        visiting
        <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The "project" is called "Oh the Huge Manatee", has a 
        "Project number" of "448264688868", and a "Project ID" of "gce-othm".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Initial clicking around appears to suggest usage of the 
    "Compute Engine API".
  </p>

  <p>
    I clicked around a bunch and came up empty. Then I remembered that it might
    actually be based on <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
    instead of Google Cloud directly. Clicking through to the console seems to
    confirm this.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am going to pause here for awhile. I think I need a personal computer with
    command line access to continue.
