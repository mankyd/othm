  <p>
    I don't add content to this site very often. I should. Part of
    the reason for that is I don't actually rememember <i>how</i>
    to get content to appear here.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I first setup this system up, I had it so that any content
    I checked into <a href="https://github.com/mankyd/othm/">github</a>
    would automatically regenerate the site and upload here. At some
    point that system stopped working, and my knowledge of how it
    was all setup atrophied.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am going to attempt to document my progress of getting it
    working again here. I'll hopefully be able to use this docunent
    as a reference in the future.
