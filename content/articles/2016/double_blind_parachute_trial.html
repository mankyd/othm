      It turns out that, as of 2003,
      <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7429/1459" title="Parachute use to prevent death and major trauma related to gravitational challenge: systematic review of randomised controlled trials">
      no proper double blind study of parachute use has been conducted</a>. That
      is to say that science doesn't technically have the most firm evidence that
      parachutes work.

      This observation is, of course, made in jest.

    <blockquote>Advocates of evidence based medicine have criticised the
    adoption of interventions evaluated by using only observational data. We
    think that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of
    evidence based medicine organised and participated in a double blind,
    randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the parachute.</blockquote>

      One of the people in the photo above is going to have a bad day. I think I
      shall cite this study more often.
