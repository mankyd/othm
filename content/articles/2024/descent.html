    I remember the descent, and the door that awaited me at the bottom.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hallways that led me to that place are less clear, but they are a 
    start. I passed through wide, carpeted hotel halls, darkly and dramatically
    lit. At some mid point, a door interrupted the hall, perpendicular to the 
    the hallway's direction of travel, as if to catch ... me.

    This was not a door meant for others. The dream made that much clear in the
    way that dreams do.

    A recessed light provided white light in a narrow field in front of the 
    door, fending off the darkness that pervaded. The door was white. A single
    panel arch-top door, details made from raised trim. The handle matched with
    a wistful curve. The edges of the trim showed a darkly - a sign of age,
    though the door felt heavy and new. As I opened the door, I noticed it fit
    snuggly in its frame.

    The door opened immediately to a stairway, as wide as the hallway it left
    behind. The stairway descended perhaps twenty feet along the side of the
    wall before both turned right. The stair continued its descent into the 
    square room, perhaps 50 feet to a side, with the door I was standing in
    located halfway along one face. The ceilings were improbably but not 
    unnaturally tall, in the way that dreams allow. The stairs followed
    almost the whole length of the wall opposite the door.

    The walls were flocked with objects in such volume that they reached out
    into space. Bicycles, boats, and balls. Pool cues and teddy bears. Toys
    furniture. All inert, simultaneously inert and haphazard. Everything was
    attached to the wall but overhead, out of the path of travel, there to be
    observed and contemplated but not touched.
