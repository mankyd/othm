      Agency will always lie with the prime actors in any violent event. I continue support
      providing the mental and societal support systems needed to help would-be criminals find the
      help they need.

      However, in the absence of any political, practical, moral, or ethical system for eradicating
      violent tendencies, we also must look to mitigate the ease and impact of such acts.

         title=""Las Vegas Shooting: Live Updates"">Stephen Paddock killed or maimed over 450
      people</a> at last count. To suggest that we ignore the implements with which this act took
      place is willful denial.

      Guns are instruments of deprivation. They act to deprive life, liberty, and freedom from those
      they are turned against. They are the antithesis of American ideals and of fundamental human
      rights. This can not stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guns make irrevocable, unchallenged decisions for their wielder. As an aggressor, a shooter
      kills the innocent. As a defender, a shooter's hasty, error-prone decisions are made
      permanent.

      They are a threat to myself, my children, my family, and everyone that I love and care about.
      There is no defense against a fired bullet. No amount of hope and prayer will bring them back
      to me as I hold their body in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, NO, I will not count their lives as the cost of liberty. Death is not freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      End the Second Amendment. End gun ownership.
