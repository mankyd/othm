    I released a new piece of software the other day, 
    <a href="https://github.com/mankyd/hookback" title="Hookback">Hookback</a>.
    It's purpose it to receive and handle webhook callback's from GitHub. I've
    seen several other projets that aim to do this, but they often seem 
    inflexible or difficult to set up. Hookback aims to be dead simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    You tell it what events to listen for on what repositories, and then you
    give it a command to run for those events. That's it. It can run those
    commands synchronousely and respond back to GitHub with the output, or it
    can run them in the background, so that long running commands to block the
    request.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, I am now using Hookback to power this site. This site is
    <a href="https://github.com/mankyd/othm" title="Oh The Huge Manatee">
      published on GitHub</a>, and when I commit and push new content to the
    repository, GitHub notifies this server. The server then runs the commands
    necessary to recompile and publish the new content on the site. It makes it
    very easy to get new content posted.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's my first real project written in
    <a href="http://golang.org/" title="Go">Go</a> and I am really enjoying it.
    It took awhile to find a groove with the syntax, but it's a real pleasure to
    use now. I am already scheming for what's next.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or features requests
    for Hookback. I aim to keep it simple, but that's not to say there isn't
    room for improvement.
