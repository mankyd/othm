    I learned
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Giraffedata/comprised_of">a new
    fact</a> today. In place of the phrase "is comprised of", one should
    generally use the phrase "is composed of". Thus, the following is
    grammatically incorrect:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The United States of America is comprised of 50 states.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    When people use "is comprised of", they usually mean more plainly
    "comprises". This would be more grammatical and in line with the meaning of
    "comprise" &mdash; "includes":
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The United States of America comprises 50 states.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    There is actually a relatively simple rule to distinguish this: "The whole
    comprises the parts; the parts compose the whole."
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the word "comprise" actually goes a step further. To use the word
    "comprise" emphasizes that the statement is <em>all inclusive</em> thus the
    following would be the most correct:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The United States of America comprises 50 states, a federal district, and 
    multiple territories.
  </blockquote>

    Hat tip to Andrew McMillen for the
    <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/meet-the-ultimate-wikignome-10508842caad">
      article</a> which put me on to this rule.
