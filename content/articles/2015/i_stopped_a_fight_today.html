    I stopped a fight today. I was on my way from work, at the
    <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=11471&lat=42.355453&lng=-71.060465"
       title="Downtown Crossing">Downtown Crossing T stop</a>, getting on the
    orange line.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was crowded and the train in the station was too full for the entirety of
    the would-be passengers to get on. I was following behind a woman who had a
    suitcase in tow. She appeared to be in a frustrated hurry, as she was 
    making her way haphazardly through the crowd.
  </p>
  <!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
  <p>
    Near one of the too-crowded doors, I believe she bumped into someone &mdash;
    evidently someone of short temperment. There may have been a 
    quick back and forth shove that I did not see. As she passed, the lady she
    had bumped into made an angry remark, turned, and pushed luggage toting 
    lady.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, luggage lady, yelling herself, fell into the crowd and I 
    found myself between the two sudden adversaries. Most people in the 
    crowded space seemed surprised or confused. I immediately stepped between
    them and instinctively found myself repeating, "It's not helping", towards
    each one in turn as they hurled expletives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The luggage lady quickly righted herself and advanced on the shover. I 
    found myself a pushing proxy, attempting to hold my ground between the two
    as they lunged for each other,
    each yelling insistently that the other had pushed first. I still found
    myself stating aloud to both, "It's not helping".
  </p>
  <p>
    A moment later some of the other passers-by collected themselves and
    assisted. The situation diffused without much further clash. The luggage
    lady continued down the platform, more flustered than before, but with less
    of a crowd in her way. I continued as well, passing her further down the
    platform. The next train came, and I assume we all boarded separate cars.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I sat on the train, I felt the onset of adrenaline in my system. It was
    neither a rush nor a high as some experience. It was simply a mildly
    unpleasant shakiness that I felt. I found myself wondering if I had done
    the right thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not that stopping the fight was wrong. Au contraire, I wondered if what I 
    was saying, "it's not helping", was in fact helping. Could I have diffused
    the situation more deftly? I intentionally demonstrated only modest
    physicalty; I had no intention of escalating the scuffle. Neither woman
    looked at me as I spoke, the locus of their glare focused on each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    What could I have said that would have broken their intensity? At least
    one person claims to have worked to
    <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/derren-brown-explains-how-to-reduce-a-mugger-to-tears-using-nothing-but-words-9859017.html">
      confuse their assailant</a>, but that trick presumes the 
    attention of the attacker. Maybe it would have worked, but it would have
    been uniquely awkward had it failed. And getting both women to hear me
    simultaneously only serves to reduce my odds of success.
  </p>
  <p>
    I did find myself coming to the question of whether I should have interfered
    at all. I happened to be in a logistically optimal spot to step between
    them, but I could have easily stepped out of the way. I asked myself this
    only because I am a father now and my own safety is more paramount than ever
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have found myself coming to the aid of the physical distressed several 
    times before. I've driven a drunk stranger to the hospital simply because
    he asked which way it was. I've helped the impaired on escalators, (a barely
    functioning drug addict who had scared everyone off). Recently
    I had a conversation with a man who, by his own accord, was suffering from 
    withdrawl of some sort, as evidenced by the vomit he was leaving on the
    train floor. A favorite of mine was a delirious man who was scaring some
    tourists; I struck up a conversation to distract him in which he told me how
    magnets will protect the United States from foreign invaders. I've stood
    between my friends and those who look like they're about to become
    physically violent.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never hesitate to do it and, to my good fortune, it's always ended well. 
    But now I find myself asking: <i>what if?</i> What if the person I help 
    sees me as a threat? What if the person I assist attacks me? It's always
    been my instinct to run <i>towards</i> these folks. It is a combination of 
    the fact that I see everyone else running away and my own naive assumption
    that bad things won't happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't want to change this habit of mine. Helping people is inherently 
    good. Good not only for the people helped, but for the public around them.
    My vitality has given me some assurance that the worst I am likely come
    away with is a bruise. As I get older, that will change. I will also start
    having my son by my side more frequently. I <em>will not</em> put him in
    harm's way. This is a question I believe I will find myself asking more
    seriously as time progresses.
