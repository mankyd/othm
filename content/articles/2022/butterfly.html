  <p>
    Yesterday, I watched my two young children and their friend stalk a yellow
    butterfly across a field of grass. They perfectly sneaked, revealed themselves,
    and gave chase again to the insect as it was carried haphazardly by the wind.

  <p>
    I watched the triplicate from some distance off, wishing I could bottle this
    moment to not just replay, but relive. This perfect moment that the children
    were experiencing without thought or introspection; without the need to assign
    value to it or compare with memory. They saw a butterfly and they gave pursuit.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I watched, wishing I could give them more.
