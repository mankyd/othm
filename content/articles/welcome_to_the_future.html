        Just a quick post: I am currently sitting in a comfortable chair, 31,842 feet 
        in the air, traveling at 430 miles per hour. It is -69&deg;F outside the 
        window I am looking through. I am remotely connected via SSH into a computer in
        the basement of my house, and from their into a connected to a laptop in my 
        home office. I tracking my location on a thin, color touch screen embedded in 
        the seat in front of me that tracks my movement through the sky at every moment.
        This, ladies and gentlemen, is amazing. Absolutely, ground shakingly amazing.

        And as if that weren't enough, I am carrying on an IM conversation with my 
        friend who is on his cell phone, currently taking a poo while at work. That's 
        awe inspiring, man.
